# Notes Application

## Overview

This application was designed to allow a user to utilize a online notes application for writing, saving and deleting notes. 

It allows a user to move away from hand written notes that can be lost or easily damages.

A user can better origanze ideas without forgetting or being unable to recall.

## User Story

As a USERT

I WANT to be able to create notes, save them, and delete notes when they are no longer needed.

SO THAT I can organize task and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Development 

I have designed the backend of this application using Express methods, designing it to take persistent notes that allow the use recall information whenever neeeded.

I learned how to connect the frontend with the backend building routes and the server. I have gained more knowledge and increased my understanding of how the database, the server, and the client comer together to build dynamic applications.

## Future Development: User Story

As a USER.

I WANT to be able to edit preexisting notes.

SO THAT I can organize and keep track of uncomepleted task.

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
