## Overview

This application was designed to allow a user to utilize an online notes application for writing, saving, and deleting notes. 

It allows a user to move away from handwritten notes that can be lost or easily damaged.

A user can better organize ideas without forgetting or being unable to recall.

## User Story

As a USER.

I WANT to be able to create notes, save them, and delete notes when they are no longer needed.

SO THAT I can organize and keep track of the progress for each task.

## Development 

I have designed the backend of this application using Express methods, designing it to take persistent notes that allow the user to recall information whenever needed. 

I learned how to connect the frontend with the backend building routes and the server. I have gained more knowledge and increased my understanding of how the database, the server, and the client come together to build dynamic applications.

## Future Development: User Story

As a USER.

I WANT to be able to edit preexisting notes.

SO THAT I can organize and keep track of uncompleted task.
